# ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Deep Learning for Text analysis & Object recognition in R

This project focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), text analysis, sentiment analysis, and machine learning techniques applied to various datasets, including PDFs, customer reviews, classic literature, stock reports, and image classification. It leverages AI methods like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning to perform complex tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and object detection.

## üöÄ Introduction

These scripts perform the following tasks:

- Text extraction and cleaning from PDFs.
- Sentiment analysis and word frequency analysis.
- Named entity recognition and syntactic analysis using SpaCy.
- N-gram analysis and term correlations.
- Topic modeling using LDA.
- Sentiment-based stock market analysis.
- Image recognition and classification with machine learning.
